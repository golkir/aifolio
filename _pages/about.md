I am software engineer wint experience in such areas as AI/ML and decentralized finance (blockchain). My background includes hands-on experience in data pipeline management, ML model training, optimisation, and deployment, MLOps, model finetuning (LLMs, speech recognition), data visualization, and integrating third-party AI/ML tools. Additionally, in my previous roles as a software developer I've developed solid knowledge of cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), containerisation technologies, microservices architecture, and good understanding of DevOps practices and workflows.

Over the last couple of years I developed strong interest in such fields of AI/ML as language modelling, diffusion models, speech recognition, and computer vision. I am trying to stay tuned to new trends in AI/ML and new tools that facilitate adoption of AI technology in enterprises.

Also, I have over 8 years of experience as tech content creator in such fields as AI/ML, web development, and cloud-native applications (Kubernetes, Docker). I have developed technical documentation for tech companies and software projects. This experience allows me to effectively convey complex tech topics to my colleagues and wider audience.
